## Why

I first started with a Wordpress/MySQL webzine but I found the Wordpress ecosystem annoying. And a bit of 'too many things involved' to just publish some content on the web.

At that time I justs started to work for iMio (www.imio.be) and heard about Plone et the Plone conf. I binge watched this conf about Lektor and it was very interesting https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R7vu1gQnrM&list=UUVtXTkZksVVghI4rjiiD4ow&index=40 
One of my colleague also think that static websites is the future. I found funny that this is also the past.

I decided to try Grindsome because I wanted to discover Vue.JS (I already had a touch with React and one my colleague already knows it so he can help if needed). Why not discover something new to share instead of tryin to master something someone can teach me.
